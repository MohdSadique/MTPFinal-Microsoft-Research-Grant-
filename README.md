# Change point Detection in Periodic Spatio-Temporal Hotspot
The changes in a spatiotemporal periodic pattern can be due to various reasons like some special event(holidays) which causes the traffic flow to increase in the cloud temporarily, or the diversion of traffic from one city to another due to some reasons(i.e. natural calamity, a breakout of war, etc.). These changes can be an anomaly point which occurred temporarily or a change in a pattern which persisted throughout the pattern. These both can be detected using the likelihood function in the supervised learning method. We focus on the persistent change detection of the pattern and the change point at which it occurred. The main aim is to detect the change throughout the pattern and not an anomaly point. We are using the CUSUM technique for changepoint detection. The code implements Naive CUSUM and Modified CUSUM algorithms for detecting changes in a time series. The current techniques are for non-periodic patterns, which do not apply to PSTH patterns. The input data is split into timeslots, and for each timeslot, we use the Modified CUSUM algorithm and present appropriate experiments and results.
